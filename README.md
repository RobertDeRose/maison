# maison

Provide a reusable public configuration framework for supported macOS and Linux systems.

This repository uses the dstack documentation-first, Beads-backed development workflow.

## Getting started

Install the workflow skills:

```bash
npx --yes skills@1.5.16 add RobertDeRose/dstack
```

The setup workflow already validates the scaffold and initializes Beads when `bd` is available. Start a session with:

```bash
bd prime
bd ready --type epic --label workflow:feature --json --limit 0
```

If setup reported Beads as outstanding, install `bd` and rerun dstack's guarded collaborative Beads initialization
before the first project commit. Do not use `bd init --stealth`: it makes Beads personal and excludes its control files
from repository tracking. The first project commit must force-add only `.beads/.gitignore`, `.beads/README.md`,
`.beads/config.yaml`, `.beads/interactions.jsonl`, `.beads/metadata.json`, and the dstack formula; embedded/runtime paths
remain ignored.

Use the installed lifecycle skills:

```text
/plan-features
/start-feature <slug>
/implement-feature <slug>
/close-feature <slug>
/audit-project
```

Install the locked developer tools, then validate or serve the documentation:

```bash
mise install --locked
mise run docs:check
mise run docs:serve
```

Run the complete quality contract with `mise run check`; apply deterministic fixes with `mise run fix`.

## Commit scopes

Changelog-visible `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, and `refactor` commits require a semantic subsystem scope. Generated projects
initially accept any syntactically valid scope because project boundaries are not known to the template.

When the stable subsystems are known:

1. Add a `scopes = ["..."]` allowlist to `cog.toml`.
2. Replace this guidance with a short table describing when each scope applies.
3. Update the Commit messages section in `AGENTS.md` so agents use the same taxonomy.

Prefer stable ownership boundaries over feature numbers, ticket identifiers, action names, or incidental files. Run
`cog check` after changing the allowlist.

The project was generated from `RobertDeRose/dstack` with Copier. Commit the scaffold before applying future template
updates with `/update-project`. Updates preserve the recorded `stable` or `unstable` channel and always record the exact
template commit used.
