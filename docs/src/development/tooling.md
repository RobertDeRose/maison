# Developer tooling

The repository uses mise to provide project tools and named tasks. Install mise, then run:

```bash
mise install --locked
```

Use the same commands locally and in automation:

```bash
mise run check
mise run fix
mise run docs:check
mise run docs:build
mise run docs:deployment:enable
mise run docs:serve
```

Use `/update-project` for the recorded template channel, or `/update-project --stable` / `--unstable` to change it. The
update always records the exact resolved template commit.

`check` is read-only. `fix` changes the working tree. Contextlint checks links, anchors, and image targets across README
and `docs/**/*.md`. The pre-commit hook may fix files while safely stashing unrelated unstaged work. The commit-message
hook enforces Conventional Commits, required scopes for changelog-visible changes, grammar, 72/100-character line
limits, and canonical optional `Beads:` footers. Harper applies its full native rule set to human-authored text after
filtering Git comments/diffs, canonical release subjects, and the canonical machine-readable footer. Run `cog changelog`
to preview the concise user-facing changelog. The hk policy uses native built-in steps whenever their behavior matches;
hk's file locking coordinates independent steps. No dependency chain serializes unrelated checks. Go projects retain
two output-sensitive edges: `gofumpt` follows `goimports`, then fix-only module tidy observes the final imports.

## Python

Ruff lint and formatting plus ty type checking run on Python files in check, fix, and pre-commit. When root
`pyproject.toml` and `tests/**/*.py` both exist, `mise run check` also runs `uv run pytest`. Pytest must be declared by
the project; setup does not add or download it.

## TypeScript

Biome check/write runs on TypeScript files in check, fix, and pre-commit. The profile reuses the universal Node runtime
and installs Aube. When root `package.json` and TypeScript test/spec files both exist, `mise run check` runs
`aube exec vitest run`. Vitest must be declared by the project; setup does not add or download
it.

## Nix

nixfmt checks and fixes Nix files on Linux and macOS ARM64. Matching Nix inputs fail clearly on unsupported macOS x64.
Root `flake.nix` enables check-only `nix flake check` and requires system Nix; setup provisions no Nix executable.

## GitHub validation

`.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs on every push and pull request. It isolates user-global mise configuration,
installs only the committed lock with `mise install --locked`, and runs `mise run check`. CI does not regenerate the
lock or maintain a separate validation policy.

## Hooks and recovery

Setup installs repository-local hk hooks when the destination is a Git repository. To restore tooling after an offline
or degraded setup, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup-tooling.py --json
```

The command gives lock, install, and hook stages one temporary `MISE_CONFIG_DIR`, removes inherited global config
overrides, and deletes the temporary directory on exit. It preserves the scaffold on failure, reports the failed stage,
and uses the same command above for recovery. A repository created without Git can install hooks after Git initialization
with:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup-tooling.py --json
```
